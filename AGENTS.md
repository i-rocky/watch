# AGENTS.md

This project follows the rules below. Treat them as required for every task.

## Workflow
- Pick microtasks in dependency order and complete them one by one.
- Commit each microtask separately.
- Everything must be tested.

## Engineering standards
- Prefer using a crate over writing custom code when it can solve the problem.
- Use the best available crate (quality, maintenance, adoption), not personal preference.
- Split files by responsibility and keep them in proper directories.

## File size
- Keep files under 200 lines unless absolutely necessary.
